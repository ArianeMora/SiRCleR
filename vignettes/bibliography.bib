Given the subsequent tumour and inter-patient heterogeneity, drug-based treatments report limited success, calling for multi-omics studies to extract regulatory relationships, and ultimately, to develop targeted therapies. Yet, methods for multi-omics integration to reveal mechanisms of phenotype regulation are lacking.<br><br><strong>METHODS:</strong> Here, we present SiRCle (Signature Regulatory Clustering), a method to integrate DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data at the gene level by following central dogma of biology, i.e. genetic information proceeds from DNA, to RNA, to protein. To identify regulatory clusters across the different omics layers, we group genes based on the layer where the gene’s dysregulation first occurred. We combine the SiRCle clusters with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reveal key features from omics’ data for each SiRCle cluster and compare patient subpopulations in a ccRCC and a PanCan cohort.<br><br><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Applying SiRCle to a ccRCC cohort, we showed that glycolysis is upregulated by DNA hypomethylation, whilst mitochondrial enzymes and respiratory chain complexes are translationally suppressed. Additionally, we identify metabolic enzymes associated with survival along with the possible molecular driver behind the gene’s perturbations. By using the VAE to integrate omics’ data followed by statistical comparisons between tumour stages on the integrated space, we found a stage-dependent downregulation of proximal renal tubule genes, hinting at a loss of cellular identity in cancer cells. We also identified the regulatory layers responsible for their suppression. Lastly, we applied SiRCle to a PanCan cohort and found common signatures across ccRCC and PanCan in addition to the regulatory layer that defines tissue identity.<br><br><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our results highlight SiRCle’s ability to reveal mechanisms of phenotype regulation in cancer, both specifically in ccRCC and broadly in a PanCan context. SiRCle ranks genes according to biological features. https://github.com/ArianeMora/SiRCle_multiomics_integration .<br><br>© 2024.

@article{Liberzon2015, title={The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection.}, volume={1}, DOI={10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004}, abstractNote={The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is one of the most widely used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for performing gene set enrichment analysis. Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.}, number={6}, journal={Cell Systems}, author={Liberzon, Arthur and Birger, Chet and Thorvaldsdóttir, Helga and Ghandi, Mahmoud and Mesirov, Jill P and Tamayo, Pablo}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={417–425}}
@article{Kanehisa2000, title={KEGG: Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.}, volume={28}, DOI={10.1093/nar/28.1.27}, abstractNote={KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).}, number={1}, journal={Nucleic Acids Research}, author={Kanehisa, M and Goto, S}, year={2000}, month={Jan}, pages={27–30}}

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions, which are not present in other frameworks. Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource comprising over 100 databases of prior knowledge. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across top methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators.<br><br><strong>AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:</strong> decoupleR’s open-source code is available in Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/decoupleR.html) for R and in GitHub (https://github.com/saezlab/decoupler-py) for Python.

@article{Müller-Dott2023, title={Expanding the coverage of regulons from high-confidence prior knowledge for accurate estimation of transcription factor activities.}, volume={51}, DOI={10.1093/nar/gkad841}, abstractNote={Gene regulation plays a critical role in the cellular processes that underlie human health and disease. The regulatory relationship between transcription factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the CollecTRI meta-resource containing signed TF-gene interactions for 1186 TFs. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to TF-gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed CollecTRI-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in TF activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by examining TF activity profiles in three different cancer types and exploring TF activities at the level of single-cells. Overall, the CollecTRI-derived TF regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of TF activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.<br><br>© The Author(s) 2023.
