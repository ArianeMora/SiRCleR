# Short Introduction
***SiRCle*** has first been released as a biorxiv preprint and since then we have enhanced the method further as part of our revision in genome medicine.
The **S**ignature **R**egulatory **Cl**ust**e**ring (SiRCle) method was first developed in 2022 to integrate DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data at the gene level to deconvolute the association between dysregulation within and across possible regulatory layers (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation). The results of the study were published on biorxiv in a shared effort by [Mora & Schmidt et. al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.02.498058v1). As part of the revisions in Genome Medicine, we have updated some parts of the SiRCle clustering method and extended our methods section in the manuscript. We also added new data and a PanCan analysis. All of this can be found in [Mora&Schmidt et al.](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-024-01415-3) [@Mora_Schmidt2024].\ 
You can find the detailed code for both manuscripts on our [website](https://arianemora.github.io/SiRCle_multiomics_integration/#) or in our [SiRCleManuscript GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArianeMora/SiRCle_multiomics_integration).\

![The SiRCle method integrates DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data at the gene level to deconvolute the association between dysregulation within and across possible regulatory layers (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation).Based on logical regulatory rules, `sircleRCM`, genes are grouped in SiRCle clusters based on the layer (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation) where dys-regulation first occurs. Using the output of `sircleRCM`, the SiRCle clusters, one can find the primary biological processes altered by applying Over Representation Analysis (ORA) (**`sircleORA`**) and the drivers behind it using Transcription Factor (TF) analysis (**`sircleTF`**). Lastly, to compare patient’s subsets (e.g. based on stage), we found that integrating across the data layers prior to performing differential analysis and biological enrichment better captures the biological signal. Hence we use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn gene-wise relationships across the three data layers to obtain an integrated value for each gene (**`sircleVAE`**). Unsing the integarted value we next perform a Mann-Whitney U test to identify genes with a significant integrated difference between the patient's groups.

# Tutorials
We have generated several tutorials/vignettes showcasing the the usage of SiRCleR using the publicly available datasets as in the manuscript [@Mora_Schmidt2024], which are included as example data within SiRCleR. You can find those tutorial on the top under the “Tutorials” button, where you can follow a specific user case example and learn more about how to choose the settings including the `Background Method`, `input data thresholds` and `Regulation Grouping`. You can also follow the links below:\
- [ChooseSettings](https://ArianeMora.github.io/SiRCleR/articles/ChooseSettings.html)\
- [DataAnalysisExample](https://ArianeMora.github.io/SiRCleR/articles/DataAnalysisExample.html)\
\
If you are seeking to also apply the variational autoencoder on the SiRCle clustering output, please visit the python package or use reticulate in R. You can find the python package on the [Python SiRCle](https://github.com/ArianeMora/scircm).
