Description: The SiRCle method integrates DNA methylation, RNA-seq and
    proteomics data at the gene level to deconvolute the association
    between dysregulation within and across possible regulatory layers
    (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation).Based on logical
    regulatory rules, `sircleRCM`, genes are grouped in SiRCle clusters
    based on the layer (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation)
    where dys-regulation first occurs. Using the SiRCle clusters, one can
    find the primary biological processes altered by applying Over
    Representation Analysis (ORA) and the drivers behind it using
    Transcription Factor (TF) analysis.
