Description: SiRCle (Signature Regulatory Clustering), a novel method to integrate DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data. 
    Applying SiRCle one can disentangle the layer (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation) where dysregulation first occurs 
    and find the primary biological processes altered.
